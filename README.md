## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition, and early detection is crucial for effective management. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify individuals who may be at risk of diabetes based on various health-related features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` directory. It includes information about individuals, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and other relevant health metrics. Make sure to review the dataset and preprocess it according to your specific requirements.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data:** Before training the model, preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model:** Train the diabetes prediction model by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input_path path/to/new_data.csv
   ```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is defined in the `model.py` file. Customize the architecture as needed for your specific use case.

## Training

Adjust the hyperparameters and training settings in the `config.yaml` file. Run the training script to train the model on your preprocessed data.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation script is available in `evaluate_model.py`.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
